## mbedCanLib

This library contrains the implementation for communication of analog and digital inputs over CAN for mbed enabled microcontrollers. CAN id's are specified to maintain consistency throughout projects implementing this library (Note: Lower numbered CAN id's have precidence on the CAN bus).

This is meant to be implemented as a submodule of another project, with the mbed-os library in the parent repositories root directory.
See example [here](https://github.com/supermileage/mbedSteering)
